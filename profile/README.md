## ✅ Recommended Usage

For **databases** such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB it is recommended to use **Percona Operators** instead of standalone Helm charts.  
Operators provide advanced features like high availability, automated backups, monitoring integration, and better lifecycle management.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to maintain free and accessible charts for testing, prototyping, and educational purposes, while encouraging production-grade deployments to move towards operators where available.
